# WebdriverIO | Jasmine (Typescript)


## Introduction
	WebdriverIO is a test automation framework that allows you to run tests based on the Webdriver protocol. It provides support for your favorite BDD/TDD test framework and will run your tests locally or in the cloud using Sauce Labs, BrowserStack, TestingBot or LambdaTest.


## Setup & Installation

** Prerequisites**
 . Download & install Microsoft VS Code.
 . Download & install NodeJS.
 . Check if node and npm installed correctly.
In command prompt, type the command
```
node -v
npm -v
```
and see if it shows the versions of node and npm.

**Project setup**
 
 . First you need to initialize a npm project
```
mkdir webdriverio-test && cd webdriverio-test
npm init -y
```
**npm init** creates package.json in the directory and it allows you to install dependencies(or dev-dependencies) using CLI (command line interface).
